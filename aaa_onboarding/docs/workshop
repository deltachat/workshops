## Anonymous account server setup

### Intro
 - What is Delta Chat?
      Delta Chat is a messaging app that works over email. You can use any existing email address, or even run a mailserver to host yourself and others.
      This means that the infrastructure is federated, there is no company owning all the data.
 - How does it help me?
 - Is it safe?
 - What is this anonymous account setup?
      It is a combination of two things:
       - mailcow - an all-in-one mail hosting solution
       - mailadm - this is our tool that generates accounts, creates them in mailcow, and removes them after they expire.
